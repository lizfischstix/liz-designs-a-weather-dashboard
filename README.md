## description
 This application is a weather dashboard created to help users retrieve local weather when vacation planning.  
 Through its creation I learned a lot about fetching and extracting relevant api data.

 ## use
 The app can be accessed at: https://lizfischstix.github.io/liz-designs-a-weather-dashboard/
 Locations' weather information will be desplayed when the user enters the name of the city whose weather data they're looking for and click the "Go!" button.
